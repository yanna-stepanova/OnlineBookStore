<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Spring Data JPA</td>
<td>It is an abstraction layer that sits on top of the Java Persistence API. It is used to access the database.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spring Data REST</td>
<td>Spring Data REST builds on top of Spring Data repositories, analyzes your application&rsquo;s domain model, and exposes hypermedia-driven HTTP resources for aggregates contained in the model.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spring MVC</td>
<td>It is used to break up a large application into smaller sections. Each section of the project is designed to illustrate its function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spring Security</td>
<td>This framework targets two major areas of application are authentication and authorization. Authentication is the process of knowing and identifying the user that wants to access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spring Boot Testing</td>
<td>It is an integral part of software development. This ensures that the program works as it should and will continue to do so even as it evolves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Liquibase support</td>
<td>This is a tool that helps developers manage and track changes to a database's structure over time. It provides an easy way to version database changes and apply them consistently across different environments. This can help ensure that database changes are made correctly and reliably, without manual intervention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Docker</td>
<td>It is a tool for deploying and running executables in isolated and reproducible environments. This may be useful, for example, to test code in an environment identical to production.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Swagger</td>
<td>It is intended for describing, creating and visualizing the operation of REST applications.</td>
